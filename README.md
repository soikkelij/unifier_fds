## UNIFIER19 C7A-HARW FLIGHT DYNAMICS SIMULATOR

This repository contains the UNIFIER19 C7A-HARW aircraft Simulink model and X-Plane 11 model. The simulator was developed to evaluate flight dynamics and control laws for distributed electric propulsion aircraft. 

Some highlights of the simulator:
- Nonlinear 6 DOF simulator
- Contains all the relevant system models: Electric motor models, actuator models, landing gear model
- The aerodynamic model captures the aero-propulsive interactions (including interaction with flap and control surfaces)
- The aerodynamic data is validated against high-fidelity CFD
- Contains all the I/O interfaces: joystick interface and X-plane 11 interface
- Comes with high fidelity X-plane 11 model for visualization or real-time simulation
- Fully supports Simulink Rapid Accelerator mode for smooth real-time simulations
- Comes with an on-board vehicle model (no integrators) ready for your control law use!

As a part of the UNIFIER19 project, we developed flight control laws based on nonlinear dynamic inversion. Paper is to be published on the findings.

>**With this model, we invite you to design your control laws! We hope this simulator will serve as an easy go-to simulator for DEP vehicles! Looking forward to your results!**

[**Here is a YouTube video on how to get started.**](https://youtu.be/k61xMRbFE0U)

PS: For the aviation enthusiast we have a standalone X-plane 11 model just for the fun of flying! (under: xplane11_model/standalone)
